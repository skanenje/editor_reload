 texEdit_tool is a text manipulation tool, offline-storage compatible, go powered text editor tool 
 
It is a tool with a variety of capabilities, it deals with some cases where the the text contains certain instances of tokens that are used to signify commands  to be undertaken on the preceding word or the text word.

Some of the tokens that are covered in the scope of this program include

+ Every instance of `(hex)` replaces the word before it to is actual value, in this case the word has been expressed in its hexadecimal form
+ Every instance of `(bin)` replaces the word before with the decimal version of the word 
+ Every instance of `(up)` converts the word before with the Uppercase version of it. if a number appears next to it, it turns the previously specified number of words accordingly.

+ Every instance of `(cap)` converts the word before with the Uppercase version of it. if a number appears next to it, it turns the previously specified number of words accordingly
+ Every instance of `(low)` converts the word before with the Uppercase version of it. if a number appears next to it, it turns the previously specified number of words accordingly
+ Every instance of the punctuations `.`, `,`, `!`, `?`, `:` and `;` is brought close to the previous word and with space apart from the next one.
+ Every instance of `a` is  turned into `an` if the next word begins with a vowel
+ The punctuation mark `'` will always be found with another instance of it and they are placed to the right and left of the word in the middle of them, without any spaces
